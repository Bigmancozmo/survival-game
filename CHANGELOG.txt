Changelog as of Oct. 29, 2021.
Many of these say "1.0.0" since I'm still building off of it,
and the game is not done yet.
These may not be up-to-date in the Windows version, since I use
Mac so Mac gets updates more often and sooner. Windows just takes
some time to upload this game for, so and it is much much simpler
on just Mac.
This changelog is in order from when the updates were made.
